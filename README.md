  ## Description: 
  
  This text editor runs in the browser. This app will be a single-page application that meets PWA criteria. It will also feature a number of data persistence         techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This will also be able to function offline.

  ## Motivation: 
  The aim is to allow users to create notes or todos with or without an internet connection so that a user can retrieve them for later use
